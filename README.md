# Physics-based 2-player Ball Keep-Up

This game is a third-person physics-based volleyball/Ball Keep-Up game, pretty straight forward.

2Player couch games are dead with the advancements in networking technologies, but the nostalgia we get from sitting with a friend and playing a game will never die.

The Goal of the game is to play Ball Keep-Up with your friend

Things I want to explore:

Is the game and objective clear?

Is the game easy to play/understand?

Does a simple game mechanic such as moving a player around and activating power-ups still provide an entertainment factor?
